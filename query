now write a query to create the following:
label: company
properties: name

label: JOB_POSTING
properties: job_id, link, processed_at, location

label: SKILL
properties: skill_Id, 
name:

label: JOB_TITLE
properties: name

relationships: 

job postings mention skills (one to many)
job title requires skills (one to many)

and suggest me any more properties if you can think of any more properties. i also want to some how store info such that i can answer queries like what skills were most demanded for a given job title in last week ,last month, last 6 months, last year, all time? but i am not sure how to store this info? or even where to store in which entity or in which relationship can you give any ideas?
